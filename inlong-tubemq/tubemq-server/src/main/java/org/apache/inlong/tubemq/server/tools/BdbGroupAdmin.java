/**
 *  Utility class for script #{bin/groupAdmin.sh} to remove node from BDB-JE replication group.
 *  Note the following rules when using.
 *
 *  1. For best results, shutdown the node before removing it.
 *
 *  2. You use the node's name (not the host/port pair) to identify the node you want to remove from the group.
 *     If the node name that you specify is unknown to the replication group, a MemberNotFoundException is thrown.
 *     If it names a secondary node, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 *
 *  3. Once removed, the electable node can no longer connect to the Master, nor can it  participate in elections.
 *     If you want to reconnect the node to the Master (that is, you want to add it back  to the replication group),
 *     you will have to do so using a different node name than the node was using when it was removed from the group.
 *
 *  4. An active Master cannot be removed from the group. To remove the active Master, either shut it down or wait
 *     until it transitions to the Replica state. If you attempt to remove an active Master, a MasterStateException
 *     is thrown.
