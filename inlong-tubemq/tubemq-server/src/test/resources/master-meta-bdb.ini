[master]
; host address of master, required; must be configured at network card, enabled
hostName=127.0.0.1
; port that master listens to, optional; default is 8715
port=8715
; port that master web console listens to
webPort=8080
; interval of re-balance, optional; default is 30000ms
consumerBalancePeriodMs=30000
; delay of first re-balance after master start; turn up when cluster grown
firstBalanceDelayAfterStartMs=60000
; timeout of consumer heartbeat, optional; default is 30000ms
consumerHeartbeatTimeoutMs=30000
; timeout of producer heartbeat, optional; default is 45000ms
producerHeartbeatTimeoutMs=45000
; timeout of broker heartbeat, optional; default is 25000ms
brokerHeartbeatTimeoutMs=25000

[meta_bdb]
; name of replication group, default is `tubemqMasterGroup`, you'd better set individual value for every tubeMQ cluster
;repGroupName=tubemqMasterGroup

; name of current node; MUST BE DIFFERENT for every node in the same group
repNodeName=tubemqMasterGroupNode1

; port for node to communicate to other nodes in replication group, default is 9001
;repNodePort=9001

; bdb meta data path; can be absolute, or relative to TubeMQ base directory ($BASE_DIR)
;   optional, default is "var/meta_data"
;   should be the same to `[bdbStore].bdbEnvHome` if upgrade from version prior 0.5.0
;   or `[master].metaDataPath` if upgrade from version prior 1.0.0
;metaDataPath=var/meta_data

; helperHost(and port) for node to join master cluster and the port should keep consistent with `repNodePort`; for the
; first time of starting, this value for every node in master cluster should keep same
; the default is 127.0.0.1:9001
;repHelperHost=masterHostName:9001

; meta data disk sync policy
;   the overall durability is a function of metaLocalSyncPolicy plus the repReplicaAckPolicy used by the master,
;     and the metaReplicaSyncPolicy in effect at each Replica
;   see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/java/com/sleepycat/je/Durability.html for detail
;   1 for SYNC, will write and synchronously flush the log to disk upon transaction commit
;   2 for NO_SYNC, do not synchronously flush the log upon transaction commit (if application or system fails, data may lost)
;   3 for WRITE_NO_SYNC, synchronously written to the OS's file system buffers upon transaction commit, but the data is not
;     actually forced to disk(if the system fails,data may lost)
; sync policy for "local", optional; default is 1(SYNC)
;metaLocalSyncPolicy=1

; sync policy for "replica", optional; default is 3(WRITE_NO_SYNC)
;metaReplicaSyncPolicy=3

; replication acknowledge policy, optional; default is 1(SIMPLE_MAJORITY)
;   1 for SIMPLE_MAJORITY
;   2 for ALL
;   3 for NONE
;repReplicaAckPolicy=1

; interval for node status check task, optional; default is 10000(ms)
;repStatusCheckTimeoutMs=10000
